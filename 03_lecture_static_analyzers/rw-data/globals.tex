   assignments         = \y, % special assignment handler
   func assignments    = \n, % can not find any handling
   value tracing       = \p, % limited constant folding and abstract interpretation for function
   controlflow         = \p, % uses abstract interpretation to check with current env but no return, continue, break
   non-standard eval   = \p, % have special function handlers for eval
   (special) operators = \p, % treated as calls
   function calls      = \p, % they traverse definitions but not resolved/just checks usage
   libraries           = \n, % does not include libraries
   quotation           = \p, % simply ignores content
   reflection          = \n, % neither body, nor substitute, ...
   side effects        = \n, % does not handle fcalls to my knowledge
   static scope        = \y, % yes, have lexical scoping
   dynamic scope       = \n, % no, no eval.parent etc?
   pointer analysis    = \n, % they just track values
   external files      = \n, % nothing for source etc!
   processors          = \n, % i can find no support whatsoever
   hooks               = \n, % does not appear
   ffi                 = \n, % does not appear
   types               = \n  % no type information
