  abstract  = {This work provides an in-depth treatment of data flow analysis technique. Apart from including interprocedural data flow analysis, this book is the first to extend detailed coverage of analysis beyond bit vectors. Supplemented by numerous examples, it equips readers with a combination of mutually supportive theory and practice, presenting mathematical foundations and including study of data flow analysis implementation through use of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Readers can experiment with the analyses described in the book by accessing the authors web page, where they will find the source code of gdfa (generic data flow analyzer).},
