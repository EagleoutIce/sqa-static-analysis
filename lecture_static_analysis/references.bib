  abstract   = {Many techniques have been developed over the years to automatically find bugs in software. Often, these techniques rely on formal methods and sophisticated program analysis. While these techniques are valuable, they can be difficult to apply, and they aren't always effective in finding real bugs.Bug patterns are code idioms that are often errors. We have implemented automatic detectors for a variety of bug patterns found in Java programs. In this paper, we describe how we have used bug pattern detectors to find serious bugs in several widely used Java applications and libraries. We have found that the effort required to implement a bug pattern detector tends to be low, and that even extremely simple detectors find bugs in real applications.From our experience applying bug pattern detectors to real programs, we have drawn several interesting conclusions. First, we have found that even well tested code written by experts contains a surprising number of obvious bugs. Second, Java (and similar languages) have many language features and APIs which are prone to misuse. Finally, that simple automatic techniques can be effective at countering the impact of both ordinary mistakes and misunderstood language features.},

  abstract   = {Dynamic languages, such as JavaScript, employ string-to-code primitives to turn dynamically generated text into executable code at run-time. These features make standard static analysis extremely hard if not impossible, because its essential data structures, i.e., the control-flow graph and the system of recursive equations associated with the program to analyze, are themselves dynamically mutating objects. Nevertheless, assembling code at run-time by manipulating strings, such as by eval in JavaScript, has been always strongly discouraged, since it is often recognized that “eval is evil,” leading static analyzers to not consider such statements or ignoring their effects. Unfortunately, the lack of formal approaches to analyze string-to-code statements pose a perfect habitat for malicious code, that is surely evil and do not respect good practice rules, allowing them to hide malicious intents as strings to be converted to code and making static analyses blind to the real malicious aim of the code. Hence, the need to handle string-to-code statements approximating what they can execute, and therefore allowing the analysis to continue (even in the presence of dynamically generated program statements) with an acceptable degree of precision, should be clear. To reach this goal, we propose a static analysis allowing us to collect string values and to soundly over-approximate and analyze the code potentially executed by a string-to-code statement.},

  abstract  = {System call filtering is widely used to secure programs in multi-tenant environments, and to sandbox applications in modern desktop software deployment and package management systems. Filtering rules are hard to write and maintain manually, hence generating them automatically is essential. To that aim, analysis tools able to identify every system call that can legitimately be invoked by a program are needed. Existing static analysis works lack precision because of a high number of false positives, and/or assume the availability of program/libraries source code - something unrealistic in many scenarios such as cloud production environments.We present B-Side, a static binary analysis tool able to identify a superset of the system calls that an x86-64 static/dynamic executable may invoke at runtime. B-Side assumes no access to program/libraries sources, and shows a good degree of precision by leveraging symbolic execution, combined with a heuristic to detect system call wrappers, which represent an important source of precision loss in existing works. B-Side also allows to statically detect phases of execution in a program in which different filtering rules can be applied. We validate B-Side and demonstrate its higher precision compared to state-of-the-art works: over a set of popular applications, B-Side's average F1 score is 0.81, vs. 0.31 and 0.53 for competitors. Over 557 static and dynamically-compiled binaries taken from the Debian repositories, B-Side identifies an average of 43 system calls, vs. 271 and 95 for two state-of-the art competitors. We further evaluate the strictness of the phase-based filtering policies that can be obtained with B-Side.},

  abstract = {Current JDK Java compiler relies on programmer's declarations (by throws clauses) for checking against uncaught exceptions of the input program. It is not elaborate enough to remove programmer's unnecessary handlers nor suggest to programmers for specialized handlings (when programmer's declarations are too broad). We propose a static analysis of Java programs that estimates their uncaught exceptions independently of the programmer's declarations. This analysis is designed and implemented based on set-based framework. Its cost-effectiveness is suggested by sparsely analyzing the program at method level (hence reducing the number of unknowns in the flow equations). We have shown that our interprocedural exception analysis is more precise than JDK-style intraprocedural analysis, and also that our analysis can effectively detect uncaught exceptions for realistic Java programs.},
