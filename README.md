This repository contains the source code for two lectures I created for the course "Software Quality Assurance" at the University of Ulm. They are designed to be the follow-up after a introduction of the general goals and techniques of static analysis.
Feel free to leave feedback in the form of issues, pull requests, or emails.

## Introduction to Abstract Interpretation

This is my first take at an introductory lecture for abstract interpretation assuming no previous knowledge on the topic (see [./lecture_abstract_interpretation/](./lecture_abstract_interpretation/)).
See [here](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/sqa-static-analysis/blob/gh-pages/lecture_abstract_interpretation/abstract_interpretation.pdf) for the animated version and [here](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/sqa-static-analysis/blob/gh-pages/lecture_abstract_interpretation/abstract_interpretation-noanim.pdf) for the handout.

## Introduction to Static Analysis Tools

This lecture focuses on how such techniques can be applied in practice, including with my own tool [flowR](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr) which is a static analyzer for R code (see [./lecture_static_analyzers/](./lecture_static_analyzers/)).
See [here](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/sqa-static-analysis/blob/gh-pages/lecture_static_analyzers/real_world_sa.pdf) for the animated version and [here](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/sqa-static-analysis/blob/gh-pages/lecture_static_analyzers/real_world_sa-noanim.pdf) for the handout.
